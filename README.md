# PineappleCake

PineappleCake is a set of add-on board and software for [Arduino MKR1000](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-mkr1000) series for attaching analog sensors. Coupled with MKR1000, PineappleCake can read up-to seven physical sensors and send the values via HTTP on WiFi.

You can also attach [triple-axis accelerometer](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12756) on PineappleCake. The acceleration data can be accessible via wireless HTTP connection.

And one more thing, you can control a couple of LEDs also via wireless HTTP connection.

You can change the IP address of multiple PineappleCakes by using attached rotary switch so that youâ€™ll never need to modify the source code for just changing the addresses.

PineappleCake also offers missing [I2C connector (+5V, D7, SCL, SDA, GND)](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-mkrzero) found in other MKR series (e.g. [MKR ZERO](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-mkrzero)).
